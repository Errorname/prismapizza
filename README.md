# PrismaPizza

This is the repository for my talk titled:

**"PrismaPizza", your GraphQL backend delivered home in 30min**

## Abstract

For some time now, we've been hearing all about GraphQL. Served as REST's replacement, we look forward to tasting this language.

But where do we start? Together, we will discover how to use Prisma and Yoga to set up a GraphQL server and link it to your database faster than a Domino's pizza delivery.

To spice it up, we will livecode a Pizza ordering application server during this talk.

Ready? Then let‚Äôs go, it‚Äôs gonna be a piece of cake! üçï
